# Land Rental System

The Land Rental System is a command-line application written in Python. It provides a convenient way to manage land rentals, generate invoices, and view available land options. The system maintains a record of rented and available lands in a text file.

## Features

- Rent land: Users can rent available lands by specifying the duration of the rental period.
- Return land: Users can return rented lands and view any fines incurred for exceeding the rental duration.
- Generate invoice: Invoices are automatically generated for each rental transaction, containing all necessary details.
- View available lands: Users can see a list of available lands with their respective details.
- Update records: The system updates the records in a text file after each rental or return transaction.

## Usage

1. Run the `land.py` script using Python.
2. Follow the prompts to select options such as renting or returning land, viewing available lands, and exiting the system.
3. Ensure that the `land.txt` file is in the same directory as the script to maintain accurate records.

## Dependencies

The system requires Python 3.x to run. There are no additional dependencies, as it uses only built-in Python modules.
